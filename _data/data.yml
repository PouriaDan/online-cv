career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
        I am a final year M.Sc. student in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran.
        My research interests include Deep Learning with applications in Computer Vision. 
        I am intended to decrease the overall amount of labeled data required in order to train neural networks. 
        To ease and eliminate the neccessity of manually labeling data, I have a particular interest in self-supervised methods. 
        My research goal is to train models with large amounts of unlabeled data and use these models across tasks and modalities.
